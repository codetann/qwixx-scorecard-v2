# Qwixx Scorecard

[Demo](https://distracted-hopper-8accec.netlify.app)

This is passion project. My family ran out of Qwixx score cards and we didnt want to go through the process of ordering more. So naturally I had
to make a web app for it.

One of the main benifits of using an online scorecard is the positive effect it will have on the environment. Paper Saved = Happy Earth.

This application is also a PWA. Allowing you to install it to your homescreen for offline use.
